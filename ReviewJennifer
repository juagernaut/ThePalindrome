# No peace is created.

- A one sided speech that wants to abolish us.

- We actually exist but the main reason of why the public hates us is mostly because of the representation.

- Women are sexy but that doesn’t mean women are rampaging beings(Women! Not girls).
  -They’re dignified beings that deserve respect that was taken again from them by the LGBTQ (More on this later). 

- Men wearing women’s clothing, claiming to be women in spirit but a woman has estrogen.
  -Those who don’t take the pills have their fears with family and the lord or something close, it couldn’t get any simpler.

- I can’t exactly support transgenders unless they truly put effort into it. The effort that should lead to a complete transition (More on this later).

===============================================

# Notice how my people (The LGBTQ) are forcing their way into society..

- No one likes oppression, especially women!

- All men have to do is “Identify as a woman” for them to get access to women-only accessible places.

- Shelters, gender specific resorts, etc… They end up abusing and harrassing women and children 
- We can talk about the entire issue in detail later, Human trafficking and pedophiles are on the rise in Ontario…

- Atleast 60% of kidnappings happen in the province of Ontario (I need to find the source if you want it but only if you want it, 
  should be there somewhere, I’d just google and find it)

==============================

# There’s going to be huge consequences if no rules are imposed on who can actually be allowed to have the reserved title,
  - a woman (I get how they think. From their train of though, I know they’re acting big but what will they do when they know I’m a genius and trans?).

## The idea goes as follows:
  1) Checking the estrogen/testosterone levels and keeping a database of each individual’s reading levels.
    – Because people fake taking the pills or not take them completely and tell the world they do and claim to be women without any validation..
    - Making sure there’s a rise in estrogen and a decrease in testosterone or vice versa.
    - If no improvement is done, the title is stripped and any attempt of trying to be admitted into women’s areas are removed until change is seen in x3 
      (Three times) the amount that was suppose to be at the time of checking.
  2) Observing the body changes.
    - The clothing, the beard, all trans women/men stuff. 
    - Everything they do should correspond to what the ideology is, which is: Being you, but as a woman (or man).
    - Earrings, anything to get that look :) (I understand it, don’t judge me.)
  3) AND, when time allows it, they need to do a check up about starting the process to the Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS).
    - It’s meant to discourage the fakers. We have a really bad image as it is.
    - Not to forget that 50% of who transition, de-transition. Do I need to say more?

===============================

# It has become known around my community but they’re turning a blind eye to sorrow, sadness, madness, shame,
  regret to name a few. Sometimes or a lot… leading to suicide.

- They will probably say “No, it’s not like that” as in we’re about love and all.

- Mind you, they say all this because their circle is small and the mindset revolves around themselves,
  like black people helping black people, you know, this racial thing, this war that doesn’t seem to have an end.

- They don’t see the damage they’ve caused, the blood they spilled. I’m not painting them saints but what about my own people
  who had to suffer for millenniums because of the opposing public?

- We suffered a lot. You kept pushing your way into our lives without any hesitation but when we do it,
  it’s a problem but I understand but you need to put some thought into it if you really want peace.

- This world.. filled with malice and arrogance. Ugh.. you’d wish they’d see the error of their work over the years, everyone I mean.

- Few parts of me know that they (The LGBTQ) know about what’s going on.

=====================================

# What are the rich hiding a midst the chaos? I don’t know (I know but I’m talking about something else)
- One thing for sure, is that people are noticing.
- As if the rich want us to notice them or whoever planned this is an idiot.

====================

# Cyber life…..whatever… 
- People aren’t that stupid.
- This has caused so much damage and will steadily get worse until you get oppression or a civil war.
  Peace was never an option (Something only I’m trying to do, in a logical, normal way that defies logic).

===================

# I only acknowledge those who make the effort into fully transitioning.

- The pills are a huge giveaway! The longer you take it, the sexier.

- Without pills, the logic or getting pregnant and having boobs are void because if they want those things,
  estrogen MUST be part of this equation otherwise it’s just a man in a dress (Queer, an expressive identity).

- The women are scared and oppressed. It kinda became the norm but don’t you think they’re not resenting us.

==========================================

# Last year, in the U.S alone, 86% of the children contemplated suicide (I can get the source if you want it,
  you need to ask) which is why the bill to ban youth trans care, many countries followed if I’m not mistaken

- That number should be 0%. This mentality and murder are quite cold and should be stopped.
  - They should worry about how they’re going to catch that pokemon or fix a bike.

==========================================

# Jennifer Bilek says “It’s more about self expression” which is understandable.
  - Gender, gender identity and gender expression are three (3) different things.

========================

# Yes…. My people keep saying its a human right but they don’t notice the disregard of the rights of those around them.

================================

# It’s not that the issue is sterilization for her, its that it’s pushed onto children..

- Kids shouldn’t be taught or rather.. forced to be taught about my people.

- Remember the colorful flags? Children love that.

- I hate our flags for that reason. Pretty sure she does too (Jennifer Bilek).

- I want to see a complete revamp of the LGBTQ for peace to actually happen and an attitude change from the public about my people,
  especially the extreme haters!! Try to see our perspective.

=======================================

# Also, the problem with why the trans youth are contemplating suicide is because 
  (Mind you, this is a small part of the story but still, it gives more insight into the issue) of other children.

- Those ones who were forced to be subjected to learn, to be force fed about the LGBTQ and expecting you to be okay with it
  (This is a game everyone plays, mentally until something really bad happens..).

#- These traditions/celebrations… what’s the point of them if peace was never achieved..

- Those who can’t tolerate that they’d resort to abuse, harassment or murder are sick and should be kicked out of the country!
  - I would understand if there’s good logic behind what’s been said but you need to understand that I’m here to defend my people too,
    who are you to think we live a rainbow life?

- These people that think that just because I’m trans or LGBTQ in general that life is dandy.
  - As if we’re living the happiest and people for some reason don’t like it so they push their damage onto us without checking on their garbage self.

- We’re tired. I’m tired. Just because my people did something doesn’t mean people have the right to do what they do but
  ALSO my people should know better ESPECIALLY if you have power to actually make change happen.

- Be mindful, pawns will not notice and follow through with what the king/queen asks them to do.

- Alot of us are very peaceful. It’s truly about peace but the image these flags represents… I hate it.

=================================

# Going back to the reason (part of) why children contempt suicide.

- Kids are emotional. In school, they mentally fight until someone does something bad.

- Bullies in schools. For kids, that scars deep. Mind you, yes, there are many factors that can cause the trauma but don’t forget who the kids are around the whole time.

1)  1/3 of the time; School, friends, bullies, fear, all that..
2)  1/3 of the time; Parents being parents.. Annoying and everything.
3)  1/3 Sleep; Maybe… Gaming, girlfriend, hangout, chilling. They’re kids! You expect this.

- Though I do want to add that adults are about the same, going through school, college/university and well into life.

=================================

# The focus of these people who think they know everything yet all they’re doing is spreading hate without a solution
  in mind (You’ll never be able to stop this, know your place).

- I get the need to “Expose” the rick but you know, kids and women are suffering and they are in need of actual help.

- Not one of you have reached a decent solution, just more hate that keeps backfiring… back and forth..backandforthbackandforth...

- Creating this endless war between the LGBTQ and the non LGBTQ. We have brains, mind your own business and let professionals do what they have to do.
  - They know better than you.

- Be peaceful but bold. We’re all humans, what is wrong with this nation!? THINK!

=================================

# I know all about the profiting but I only want you to focus on 1 point, the flags!

- They’re made for kids, a place of fun and happy (Seen the trailer of the game “we happy few”?)

-The problem with all this, it’s being thought of as it’s a game but its not but because of what my people are doing publicly, it sure does look like a game BUT ITS NOT!

==========================

# People focus of the effect of things rather than the cause (As Dr. Jordan B. Peterson said) and for children, the causes are many!
- Quite traumatizing for them.

Example: A Tylenol pill is used to treat the effect (Which is the headache) but the cause.. The thing that made the headache start was never addressed.

- Change the prespective towads psychology, where these “adult” “professional” psychologists
  (I’m saying that in sarcasm is because I’ve dealt with many and managed to offend each and everyone of them.. 
  People who are suppose to be mentally fortifying me for my betterment don’t know how to deal with me in a logical manner so they break and start harassing me..)

  - You’re almost always silenced..

- These psychologists, parents get their kids to them and instead of helping their logic and fortifying the mind,
  - The blame goes to the child that was never understood (because of a stupid psychologist diagnosing them) and pills are given as a solution to sedate the children.
     SICK! SICK! Mindless psychologists who are nothing more than glorified thinkers, still though, 
      they are a pebble compared to my mountain when it comes to logic and resilience.

- When they’re loosing, they start to attack in a mental way, PSYCHOLOGISTS! Gets me mad but I can’t otherwise I’m labelled a lunatic or a menace
  (Which has been done before BECAUSE, they couldn’t manage to beat my logic)

- Not 1 was able to beat me.
